{"name":"TiTouchDB","tagline":"Titanium wrapper around Couchbase Lite","body":"# TiTouchDB\r\n\r\nby Paul Mietz Egli (paul@obscure.com)\r\nbased on Couchbase Lite iOS by Jens Alfke (http://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios)\r\nand Couchbase Lite Android by Traun Leyden (http://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android)\r\n\r\n**TiTouchDB** is an Appcelerator Titanium module which wraps Couchbase Lite, the lightweight, CouchDB-compatible\r\ndatabase suitable for embedding into mobile apps.\r\n\r\n## Using the Module\r\n\r\nSee the Wiki pages for usage instructions and the samples directory for example apps.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Titanium SDK 3.1.0 or later\r\n* Xcode 4.5 or later (iOS), runtime requirement is iOS 5+\r\n* Android SDK r21.1, runtime requirement is android-8\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n* TiTouchDB is under the Apache License 2.0\r\n* Couchbase Lite is under the Apache License 2.0. See that project for additional licenses.\r\n\r\n## Development Status - iOS\r\n\r\n**0.9**\r\n\r\n2013-05-17\r\n\r\nMerged `public-api` branch to master.  Please see [the docs](https://github.com/pegli/ti_touchdb/wiki/API)\r\nfor changes to the module APIs.\r\n\r\n2013-02-06\r\n\r\nLots of changes in the TouchDB-iOS world!  Jens has been working on a\r\n[new, in-process API](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS/wiki/API-Transition)\r\nthat replaces the HTTP listener plus CouchCocoa system that was previously the recommended way\r\nof using TouchDB.  The \"public API\" branch in the TouchDB repo where this work has been done\r\nwill be the basis for the 1.5 release of TouchDB.  In addition, TouchDB 1.5 will be\r\n[renamed to Couchbase Lite](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mobile-couchbase/vaB8H1dlagA).\r\nThe code has already been moved to [new Github repo](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios)\r\nand its internal names have been modified to reflect the branding change.  The *public-api*\r\nbranch of this project is where I have been working to integrate these API changes.  When\r\nCouchbase Lite 1.5 goes beta, I will be merging public-api to master.\r\n\r\n2013-01-18\r\n\r\nTouchDB-iOS has a new branch named `public-api` which removes the need for CouchCocoa\r\nand changes all of the calls to in-process rather than deferred/HTTP.  I've created a\r\npublic-api branch in this repo where I will be converting the module to use the updated\r\nlibrary calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n2012-10-11\r\n\r\nAdded support for filters; new tutorial code under samples\r\n\r\n2012-10-01\r\n\r\nFixed problem with map and reduce functions being garbage collected by the JS context.\r\n\r\n2012-08-30\r\n\r\nBrand-spanking new TouchBooks example built with the \"Master/Detail\" application template\r\nfrom Titanium Studio.  The new code should be much easier to understand, and as a bonus\r\nit includes push and pull replication to an IrisCouch server!\r\n\r\nLatest build of the project uses the head of TouchDB-iOS to get a JSON view collation bug\r\nfix.\r\n\r\n## Development Status - Android\r\n\r\n**0.9-beta**\r\n\r\n2013-05-17\r\n\r\nMerged `public-api` branch to master.  Android is passing tests 001-005; working on\r\nimplementing the rest of the unit tests.\r\n\r\n2012-10-11\r\n\r\nFaked the persistent replication classes for API compatibility with iOS by wrapping TDReplicator;\r\nwill update when TouchDB-Android has persistent replication.\r\n\r\n2012-08-30\r\n\r\nThe new TouchBooks example also works on Android.  It's cool.  Check it out.\r\n\r\nAndroid version uses the latest version to TouchDB-Android.  Replication is working in the\r\ntest case and in TouchBooks, but Marty Schoch, the author of TouchDB-Android, reports that\r\nthere are issues with the replicator, so proceed with caution.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
