CouchBooks Sample App for TiTouchDB
===================================

This app is a blatant copy of the CoreDataBooks application which uses the
Couchbase Mobile for iOS and the ti_touchdb module for data storage.  The
original CoreDataBooks app can be found here:

This sample illustrates how to initialize a TouchDB database, load default
data and design documents, and populate Titanium UI objects with data from
TouchDB.  It includes a CommonJS module that provides a more database-like
interface on top of the asynchronous HTTP calls that are used to access
TouchDB.

In order to run this example, you must have installed the ti_touchdb module.

Feel free to log issues with this application on the ti_touchdb Github project.

Time to relax!
