# ToDoLite Sample App

This sample app is designed to be a functional equivalent of the [ToDoLite](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/ToDoLite-iOS)
example provided by Couchbase.

## Setup

1. Install the TiTouchDB module using gittio or by copying the module ZIP files to this directory.
1. Create a directory named `app/assets/alloy/sync` and copy the `titouchdb.js` sync adapter file
   to that directory.  If you have cloned this project from Github, you can make a symlink by
   running `ln -s ../../../../mobile/noarch/alloy app/assets/`.
1. TODO set up remote database to sync to.
1. Build and run as usual.
