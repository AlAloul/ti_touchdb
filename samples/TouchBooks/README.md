TouchBooks Sample App for TiTouchDB
===================================

This app is a blatant copy of the CoreDataBooks application which uses the
ti_touchdb module for data storage.  The difference between this example app
and the CouchBooks example app is that CouchBooks uses the HTTP API for TouchDB
and this app uses the in-process API.

The original CoreDataBooks app can be found here:

  http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/CoreDataBooks/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008405

This example illustrates how to initialize a TouchDB database, replicate data
from an IrisCouch instance, and get data from views.

In order to run this example, you must have installed the ti_touchdb module, the
TouchDB framework, and the CouchCocoa framework.

Feel free to log issues with this application on the ti_touchdb Github project.

Time to relax!
