TouchBooksAlloy
===============

See the [Alloy and TouchDB Tutorial](https://github.com/pegli/ti_touchdb/wiki/Alloy-and-TouchDB-Tutorial)
on the wiki for information about this sample app.

Running the App
---------------

If you just want to run the TouchBooksAlloy sample app, follow these steps:

1. Build or obtain a binary ZIP file of the ti_touchdb module for iOS or Android.  Make sure the version
of the file matches the declared version in `tiapp.xml`.
2. The first time you build, you need to run `mkdir Resources` and `touch Resources/app.js` to get around
a problem with the Titanium CLI.
3. Run `titanium build -p iphone` or `titanium build -p android` to run the app in the appropriate simulator.
