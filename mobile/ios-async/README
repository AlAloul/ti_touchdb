WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?

For the past few weeks, I've been running into a lot of issues with the version
of TiTouchDB in ../ios.  First, the view compilation code that was working ok back
in March and April stopped functioning.  Next, I started getting 404 errors back
from CouchCocoa for built-in URLs like _all_docs.  Finally, as I was trying to
rework the view compiler code, I ran into an intractable problem with threading
and JavaScript compilation.

As an experiment, I have creating a new, "slimline" version of the module which
exposes TouchDB over HTTP instead of using the CouchCocoa layer.  By eliminating
layers of code, I hope to get the module functional for everyone who has been
asking for it.  In this version, the module acts just like an embedded CouchDB
server.  Clients interact with the server using asynchronous HTTP calls instead of
the pseudo-synchronous objects provided by CouchCocoa.
